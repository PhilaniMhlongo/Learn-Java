## 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) <a name="oop"></a>

In this section, we delve into the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming. Topics covered include classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. You will find code examples and explanations to reinforce your understanding of OOP in Java.

### Resources:
- [Understanding OOP in Java](./oop/README.md)

## 2. Concurrency <a name="concurrency"></a>

Concurrency is a crucial aspect of modern software development. This section explores concepts related to concurrent programming in Java, such as threads, synchronization, and the java.util.concurrent package. Learn how to write efficient and thread-safe code to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

### Resources:

## 3. Algorithms and Data Structures <a name="algorithms-and-data-structures"></a>

Understanding algorithms and data structures is essential for writing efficient and scalable programs. In this section, we cover various algorithms, sorting techniques, and data structures commonly used in Java programming. Explore the principles behind algorithmic problem-solving and the efficient management of data.
